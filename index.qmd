We can use Quarto to have a public facing website that is hosted on Github. Github can host all the code and PDF files, but videos are best hosted on YouTube.

We could alternatively format this in a more linear book format. See an example here: <https://jjallaire.github.io/hopr/dice.html>

Or more examples quarto websites and books here: <https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites>
